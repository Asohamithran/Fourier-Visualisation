# Fourier-Visualisation
A visual representation of  Fourier series expansion of a Square wave  
This is a code snippet of  fourier series expansion of a periodic square wave . Each frequency is represented as a points in a circle moving at different speeds that helps to visualise a sine wave .
This code was inspired from Fourier visualisation by DANIEL SHIFFMAN in p5js platform . 
I have recreated the code in processing.
