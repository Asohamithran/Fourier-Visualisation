# Fourier-Visualisation
A visual representation of  Fourier series expansion of a Square wave  
This is a code snippet of fourier series expansion of a periodic square wave . Each frequency is represented as a points in a circle moving at different speeds that helps to visualise a sine wave .
A periodic square wave can be represented as a sum of weighted sine and cosine harmonics called the *Fourier series*
## Fourier series expansion of a square wave can be given by :
## <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F(x)=4/\pi*\Sigma_{k=0}^{\infinity}(\sin(2\pi (2k-1) * ft/(2k-1))">
where f is the frequency and t is the time 
### *when I used 3 harmonics to describe the wave is not really a square wave.*

### *30 harmonics describing the square wave signal accurately.*
